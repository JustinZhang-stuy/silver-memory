<h2>Beginning of Interest</h2>
<p>
My interest in Minecraft began when I was a kid. Minecraft is a fun sandbox game that lets people do as they wish. 
People can build, mine, craft, fight, and so on. Minecraft was in its prime years: many people were discovering the game and falling in love with it. 
Gameplay of it swarmed large platforms like Youtube. Unfortunately, since I was a toddler during Minecraft's peak, I couldn't buy Minecraft.
I was left with no choice but to watch more Minecraft videos in envy. The closest I came to experiencing the joys of Minecraft was Minecraft Pocket Lite.
This was as great as a middle school musical could ever go: it sucked. I would have to keep dreaming for the day I could buy Minecraft for myself.

<h2>Bedrock Era</h2>
<p>
At long last, I got my hands on Minecraft! But it's Pocket Edition (which was renamed to Bedrock Edition later)! It's Minecraft but for mobile devices.
It's a big improvement from Minecraft Demo Version. I can actually build, mine, craft, fight, and so on. I could enjoy the joys of Minecraft truely now!
Except that it's still not the real deal. Pocket Edition is meant to be a version of Minecraft that has been downgraded in order for mobile devices to handle it.
That meant that I was playing downgraded Minecraft. And soon after, newer games started popping in and Minecraft fell past its peak, sinking into a dark age.
Minecraft hit bedrock (which can only be found at the bottom of a Minecraft world), and was even dethroned as the best selling game by another game.
I lost interest in Minecraft to pursue other games that had more to offer. And then another game takes the throne as the new hot stuff. It is ... Minecraft?

<h2>A New Era</h2>
<p>
One of the things I love about Minecraft is its amazing ability keep its players for a long time. The other competitors quickly died out while Minecraft continued to grow.
A surge in popularity for Minecraft, boosted by nostalgia and PewDiePie's Minecraft gameplay (subscribe to PewDiePie), drew new and returning players to the game.
Just like its first peak, Minecraft content became popular. This time, I got my hands on the real deal: Minecraft Java Edition, the supreme version, better than the rest.
It's exciting to see where Minecraft will go next. Its recent peak has generated nostalgia for returning players and created childhoods for new players. What's after nostalgia?
We'll just have to watch...
